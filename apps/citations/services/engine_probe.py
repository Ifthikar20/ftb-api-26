"""AI-engine lane for Brand Research.

Asks every configured LLM the scan's query the way a customer would, then
reads the answer with the same extractor the web lane uses. The result is
the part of the graph a Google search cannot give you: which engines
recommend which brands, and which pages taught them to.

Three things distinguish this from ``brand_vault``'s ``ask_all_providers``:

1. Unconfigured providers get a row with ``status="not_configured"`` instead
   of being silently dropped, so the UI can grey out an engine rather than
   pretend it does not exist.
2. Answers go through ``analyze_content`` -- the same prompt, schema and
   junk filter as a web page -- so an engine's brand mentions are directly
   comparable to a Reddit thread's.
3. Cited URLs are pulled out and cross-linked against the scan's own source
   rows, which is what lets the graph draw "this engine recommends that
   brand because of this page".

Never raises. A dead engine costs its own row, not the scan.
