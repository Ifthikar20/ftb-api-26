"""Raise Brand Security findings from audit responses already on record.

The external-source security agents each re-query providers with their own
``SafetyPrompt``. That costs a second round of API calls and, more
importantly, judges answers nobody ever sees: the responses on the
dashboard and the prompt detail page are a different set entirely.

This module reads ``LLMRankingResult`` rows the audits already produced
and raises ``SafetyAlert`` rows linked back to the exact response via
``SafetyAlert.result``. Every finding is therefore traceable — a reader
can open the answer the judgement was made against, and the alert's
``evidence_spans`` mark the exact characters that triggered it.

Detection is the registry in :mod:`.detectors` — one stable code per
trigger type (``BS-SENT-001`` ...). Nuanced detectors escalate to the
RAG-grounded LLM judge according to their ``judge_mode``, behind three
gates: the ``BRAND_SECURITY_JUDGE_ENABLED`` setting, the per-website
``BrandSecurityConfig.llm_judge_enabled`` flag, and the tenant's monthly
AI cost cap (plus a hard per-scan call budget).

Persistence contract:

* Idempotent per ``(website, result, detector_code)`` — rescanning the
  same response changes nothing.
* A finding recurring on a *new* response of the same prompt/provider
  stream (same ``dedupe_key``) bumps ``occurrence_count`` on the open
  alert and repoints it at the newest response instead of stacking a
  duplicate row per scan.
* Resolved and dismissed alerts are never reopened — a re-firing after
  resolution creates a fresh alert with a fresh reference.
