"""
Plackett-Luce model for ranking brands across LLM responses.

Each LLM response gives a ranking like [brand_a, brand_b, brand_c, ...].
Plackett-Luce fits a strength s_i per brand such that

    P(item i ranked first among S) = w_i / sum_{j in S} w_j

and a full ranking factors as a product of such top-1 choices.

We fit via the MM (minorisation-maximisation) iteration from
Hunter (2004) "MM algorithms for generalized Bradley-Terry models",
which is a closed-form update with guaranteed monotone log-likelihood
improvement and no learning rate to tune.

Implementation note: pure Python (no NumPy dependency) since the brand
counts per audit are small (typically < 50) and iteration counts are
modest (< 200). Avoids pulling NumPy/SciPy into the runtime.
