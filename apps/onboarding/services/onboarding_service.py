Onboarding orchestrator.

Single entry point for the post-register flow: take a URL, return
everything we know about the business so the user only has to confirm
or tweak rather than type from scratch.

Composes three existing services:
    1. ``apps.llm_ranking.services.domain_scanner.scan_domain``
       — homepage scrape, products / features / selling points / topics
    2. ``apps.onboarding.services.description_writer.polish_description``
       — short Claude pass that rewrites the meta description into the
       1-2 sentence "what we do" copy the user actually wants to see
    3. ``apps.llm_ranking.services.competitor_discovery.discover_competitors``
       — Google-Search-backed real competitor list

All three are best-effort. A failure in any one returns a degraded
result rather than aborting; the frontend renders whatever fields came
back so the user can fill the rest by hand.
