"""
Onboarding API.

Two endpoints, both authenticated:

    POST /api/v1/onboarding/scan/   — preview: scan + describe + competitors
    POST /api/v1/onboarding/save/   — commit: create the Website row

The scan endpoint is intentionally read-only so the user can iterate on
URL / description until they're happy before we persist anything.
