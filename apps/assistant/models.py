"""Conversation persistence for Ask Cansee.

The assistant shipped as a side panel whose thread lived only in Pinia, so
reloading the tab lost it. Moving the assistant onto its own page means the
sidebar lists past chats, and a list needs somewhere to read from.

Isolation: a conversation is pinned to BOTH the website and the user who
started it. Every query filters on both, and the website itself is resolved
through the tenant gate first, so a conversation id from another tenant
resolves to nothing rather than to someone else's thread.
