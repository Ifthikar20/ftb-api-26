"""Optional vector-index backends for RAG retrieval.

Postgres remains the source of truth for every chunk (text, provenance,
metadata). A backend is a *derived index* over the embeddings only, used
to replace the fetch-everything-and-score-in-Python candidate selection
in retriever.py. If the index is lost it is rebuilt from Postgres; the
reverse is not true, which is why nothing but vectors lives here.

Selected by settings.RAG_VECTOR_BACKEND:

  "python"  (default) No index. retriever.py keeps its current
            behaviour: load all (user, website) chunks, cosine in a loop.
  "chroma"  Embedded ChromaDB (PersistentClient) at RAG_CHROMA_PATH.
            One collection per (website, embedding-dim). In-process,
            no server, HNSW under the hood.

Scope and limits, stated plainly:

- Single-process assumption. Chroma's PersistentClient is not safe for
  concurrent writers from separate processes. Locally (runserver +
  eager Celery) that holds. In production web and celery are separate
  containers WITHOUT a shared filesystem, so this backend as-is cannot
  serve them both - that deployment needs either Chroma's server mode
  (a new service) or the pgvector column instead. This module exists to
  evaluate the retrieval quality and speed locally before that call.
- Collections are keyed by embedding dimension, mirroring the dim-guard
  in retriever.py, so 1536-dim OpenAI vectors and the 256-dim test/hash
  fallback never mix in one index.
- Deleting a KnowledgeSource through the API removes its vectors; bulk
  deletes that bypass the service layer (admin, shell) leave orphans in
  the index. Orphans are harmless at query time - hits are re-fetched
  from Postgres by id, so a vanished chunk simply drops out - and a
  reindex clears them.
