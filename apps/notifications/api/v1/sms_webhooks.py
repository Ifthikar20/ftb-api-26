"""Inbound SMS webhook (Twilio).

Two-way texting: a subscriber can reply to an alert with a plain-English
question and get an answer from the same assistant that backs the Slack
and Discord bots and the Ask page.

Order of business on every inbound message:

  1. Verify the Twilio signature. Without it this is an open endpoint and
     anyone can impersonate a subscriber's number.
  2. Apply STOP / START / HELP. Carrier-mandated, and an opt-out has to
     work even if everything after it is broken.
  3. Otherwise answer the question, scoped to that subscriber's own data.

Tenancy: the answering user comes from the SUBSCRIPTION matched on the
sending number, never from the message body. A text cannot ask about
someone else's account because there is no field in which to name one.
