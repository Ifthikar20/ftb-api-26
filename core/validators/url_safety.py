"""
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) protection.

Any code path that fetches a URL supplied (directly or transitively) by
the user must run that URL through ``assert_url_safe`` first. This
module enforces:

    1. Scheme allowlist (http / https only). No file://, ftp://,
       gopher://, dict://, ldap://, jar://, etc.
    2. Hostname must resolve to a routable public address. Loopback,
       private RFC 1918, link-local (including AWS / GCP / Azure
       metadata endpoint 169.254.169.254), reserved, multicast,
       broadcast, and unspecified addresses are rejected.
    3. IPv6 equivalents of all the above.
    4. Host length and basic format checks so malformed input fails
       fast rather than reaching ``requests``.

Limitations:
    - DNS rebinding (a domain that resolves to a public IP at check
      time but flips to a private one before the fetch) is partially
      mitigated by the fact that ``requests`` does its own resolve
      and the windows are short, but not fully eliminated. The
      hardened path is to resolve once and pin via the Host header;
      we accept the residual risk in exchange for simpler call sites.
    - We don't run egress through an isolated network; this module
      is a defense layer, not a substitute for network segmentation.

The existing ``core.validators.url_validator.validate_website_url`` is
left in place for API form validation but is too loose to be relied on
as a fetch guard.
